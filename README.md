This is a mini browser game that I made to explore various possibilities of programming with JavaScript & jQuery.

It is a simple game that relies on the hand-eye coordination and speed of the player to click rapidly and accurately on the enemies to neutralize them. 

It contains many different functions like:
  - randomizing background image on button click with a checker so the same image does not appear twice in a row,
    - also, another function that keeps track of conquered places (scenery) so you can not travel there until the game is won or restarted,
  - disabling and enabling choices on dropdown menu (not that hard, I know :) ),
  - keeping track of score through the levels and changing difficulty after every won level. 

And many others, it is a simple game, really.
